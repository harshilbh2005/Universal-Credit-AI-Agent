  "summary_report": [
    "The Act's primary purpose is to alter the rates of the standard allowance, Limited Capability for Work (LCW) element, and Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element of Universal Credit, as well as rates of income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA IR).",
    "It mandates the Secretary of State to ensure the Universal Credit standard allowance for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30 is increased annually by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) plus an additional uplift percentage.",
    "A new LCWRA element amount (\u00a3217.26) is introduced for new claimants from April 2026, while a 'protected LCWRA amount' is maintained for pre-2026 claimants, severe conditions criteria claimants, and terminally ill claimants.",
    "The Act freezes the LCWRA and LCW elements of Universal Credit, and specific components of ESA IR (disability premiums, support component, work-related activity component) for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, by disapplying the standard annual up-rating mechanism.",
    "It obliges the Secretary of State to ensure that the combined sum of the protected LCWRA amount and the standard allowance, or certain legacy ESA IR payments, increases by at least the relevant CPI percentage annually.",
    "Key eligibility changes include the definition of 'pre-2026 claimants' (those continuously on LCWRA before April 2026) and 'severe conditions criteria claimants' (those with lifelong, diagnosed severe conditions meeting specific descriptors).",
    "The Act includes corresponding provisions in Schedule 2 to ensure similar changes are implemented for Universal Credit and legacy benefits in Northern Ireland.",
    "The main provisions related to LCWRA element changes and assessments come into force on 6 April 2026."
